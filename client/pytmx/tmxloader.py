v2.15.2 - for python 2.6 and 2.7

If you have any problems or suggestions, please contact me via email.
Tested with Tiled 0.8.1 for Mac.

released under the LGPL v3

===============================================================================

New in 2.15.2:
   general: new version number to reflect supported python version
   general: python 3 support in new library

New in .15:
    loader: new getTileLayerByName(name) method
    loader: python 2.6 support
    loader: fixed issue where objects with tile gid did not load properties
    loader: polygon and polyline objects
    loader: new lookup methods use iterators
    loader: loading function moved into classes
    loader: data/images can be reloaded on the fly
    loader: uses etree for faster xml parsing

New in .14:
    loader: Fixed gid lookup for "buildDistributionRects"
    loader: Added useful output to a few classes "__repr__"
    loader: Fixed a gid mapping issue that broke rotated tiles
    pygame: fixed colorkey handling
    pygame: correctly handles margins and spacing between tiles in tilesets
    pygame: b/c of changes, now correctly renders tiled's example maps
    added scrolling demo

New in .13:
    loader: Renamed "get_tile_image" to "getTileImage"
    loader: Removed duplicates returned from getTilePropertiesByLayer
    loader: Modified confusing messages for GID errors
    loader: Fixed bug where transformed tile properties are not available
    loader: No longer loads metadata for tiles that are not used

    loader: Removed 'visible' from list of reserved words
    loader: Added 'buildDistributionRects' and maputils module
    loader: Added some misc. functions for retrieving properties
    pygame: Smarter tile management made tile loading cache useless; removed it
    pygame: pygame.RLEACCEL flag added when appropriate

New in .12:
    loader: Fixed bug where tile properties could contain reserved words
    loader: Reduced size of image index by only allocating space for used tiles

New in .11:
    loader: Added support for tileset properties
    loader: Now checks for property names that are reserved for internal use
    loader: Added support for rotated tiles
    pygame: Only the tiles that are used in the map will be loaded into memory
    pygame: Added support for rotated tiles
    pygame: Added option to force a bitsize (depth) for surfaces
    pygame: Added option to convert alpha transparency to colorkey transparency
    pygame: Tilesets no longer load with per-pixel alphas by default
    pygame: Colorkey transparency should be correctly handled now

===============================================================================

Installation:

    There is no install script.  To use PyTMX in your projects, just copy
    the folder into your project directory and follow the guide below.


Basic usage sample:

    >>> from pytmx import tmxloader
    >>> tmxdata = tmxloader.load_pygame("map.tmx")
    >>> tmxdata = tmxloader.load_pygame("map.tmx", pixelalpha=True)

The loader will correctly convert() or convert_alpha() each tile image, so you
don't have to worry about that after you load the map.


When you want to draw tiles, you simply call "getTileImage":

    >>> image = tmxdata.getTileImage(x, y, layer)
    >>> screen.blit(image, position)


Maps, tilesets, layers, objectgroups, and objects all have a simple way to
access metadata that was set inside tiled: they all become object attributes.

    >>> layer = tmxdata.tilelayers[0]
    >>> layer = tmxdata.getTileLayerByName("Background")

    >>> print layer.tilewidth
    32
    >>> print layer.weather
    'sunny'


Tiles properties are the exception here, and must be accessed through
"getTileProperties".  The data is a regular Python dictionary:

    >>> tile = tmxdata.getTileProperties(x, y, layer)
    >>> tile["name"]
    'CobbleStone'


===================================================================================
IMPORTANT FOR PYGAME USERS!!
The loader will correctly convert() or convert_alpha() each tile image, so you
shouldn't attempt to circumvent the loading mechanisms.  If you are experiencing
problems with images and transparency, pass "pixelalpha=True" while loading.

ALSO FOR PYGAME USERS:  Load your map after initializing your display.
===================================================================================

NOTES:

* The Tiled "properties" have reserved names.

If you use "properties" for any of the following object types, you cannot use
any of these words as a name for your property.  A ValueError will be raised
if a Tile Object attempts to use a reserved name.

In summary: don't use the following names when adding metadata in Tiled.

As of 0.8.1, these values are:

map:         version, orientation, width, height, tilewidth, tileheight
             properties, tileset, layer, objectgroup

tileset:     firstgid, source, name, tilewidth, tileheight, spacing, margin,
             image, tile, properties

tile:        id, image, properties

layer:       name, x, y, width, height, opacity, properties, data

objectgroup: name, color, x, y, width, height, opacity, object, properties

object:      name, type, x, y, width, height, gid, properties, polygon,
             polyline, image

def load_images_pygame(tmxdata, mapping, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    due to the way the tiles are loaded, they will be in the same pixel format
    as the display when it is loaded.  take this into consideration if you
    intend to support different screen pixel formats.

    by default, the images will not have per-pixel alphas.  this can be
    changed by including "pixelalpha=True" in the keywords.  this will result
    in much slower blitting speeds.

    if the tileset's image has colorkey transparency set in Tiled, the loader
    will return images that have their transparency already set.  using a
    tileset with colorkey transparency will greatly increase the speed of
    rendering the map.

    optionally, you can force the loader to strip the alpha channel of the
    tileset image and to fill in the missing areas with a color, then use that
    new color as a colorkey.  the resulting tiles will render much faster, but
    will not preserve the transparency of the tile if it uses partial
    transparency (which you shouldn't be doing anyway, this is SDL).


    TL;DR:
    Don't attempt to convert() or convert_alpha() the individual tiles.  It is
    already done for you.
